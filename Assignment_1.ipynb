    "1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be \n",
    "integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",
    "*\n",
    "'hello'\n",
    "-87.8\n",
    "-\n",
    "/\n",
    "+\n",
    "6\n",
    " \n",
    "Solution:- * is an expression as it is used to multiply two integers.\n",
    "           'hello' is a value as it is a string.\n",
    "           -87.8 is a value as it is a float data type.\n",
    "           - is an expression as it subtracts two integers or numbers.\n",
    "           / is an expression as it divides two integers or numbers.\n",
    "           + is an expression as it adds two integers or numbers.\n",
    "           6 is a value as it belongs to integer datatype\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:- A variable is like a memory location where it can hold data of different data-types like\n",
    "           int, float,char, bool etc.\n",
    "           String is one of the data-type where the variable considers the string value as a data and stores in it.\n",
    "           \n",
    "3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:- int is one of the datatype used to store positive and negative whole numbers.\n",
    "           bool is a data-type which represents one of the 2 values i,e.. True or False.\n",
    "           Complex number is represented by complex class. It is specified as \n",
    "           (real part) + (imaginary part)j. For example â€“ 2+3j.\n",
    "           \n",
    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:- An expression is a combination of operators and operands that is interpreted to produce some other value.\n",
    "           an expression is evaluated as per the precedence of its operators\n",
    "           x = 25 is a statement\n",
    "           y = 12 is a statement\n",
    "           x+(y+10) is an expression where it performs the math operation in brackets first and then that value is \n",
    "           added to x to give the value which is 47\n",
    "\n",
    "5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:- In Python, an expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators that evaluates to a single value. For            example, the expression 2 + 3 evaluates to 5. A statement, on the other hand, is a complete instruction that tells              the program to perform a specific action, such as assignment or control flow. For example, the statement x = 2 + 3              assigns the value of the expression 2 + 3 to the variable x.Here also, we're assigning the value of 10 to variable              spam\n",
    "\n",
    "6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:- 23\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "'spam'+'spamspam'\n",
    " 'spam' * 3\n",
    " \n",
    "Solution: 'spamspamspam'\n",
    "          'spamspamspam'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:- In Python, variable names must start with a letter or an underscore (_), and can include letters, digits, and \n",
    "           underscores. However, they cannot start with a digit. This means that \"eggs\" is a valid variable name because it                starts with a letter, while \"100\" is not valid because it starts with a digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string\n",
    "version of a value?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:- The int(), float(), and str() functions will evaluate to the integer, floating-point number, and string versions of            the value passed to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "'I have eaten'+99+'burritos.'\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:- 'I have eaten'+99+'burritos.'\n",
    "           can only concatenate str (not \"int\") to str\n",
    "           To resolve the error we can add apostrophe(') or Quotation(\") to 99 in the following expression, so that, it       \n",
    "           considers '99' as a string(str) along with 'I have eaten' and 'burritos'\n",
